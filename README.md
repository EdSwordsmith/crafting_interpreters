# My journey through "Crafting Interpreters"

I enjoyed my compilers class in college and wanted to learn and explore a little more. First, I went to make a [brainfuck compiler](https://github.com/EdSwordsmith/brainfuck) ([actually two](https://github.com/EdSwordsmith/brainfuck_rs)). A friend told me about this book and now I've decided to go through it.
