# Examples

This folder is meant to hold some examples of lox programs, which I'm using to test the interpreter while it's being implemented. I had some examples already written from the challenge in one of the early parts. However, when I wrote those I attempted to test the limits of the interpreter when it comes to data structures and also higher-order functions, and right now I need some examples with different complexities that can be used to test an interpreter still being developed.
