# 14 - Chunks of Bytecode

I wanted to keep the same strategy as I had on the first half, where I choose to follow along with a different language which makes me read and understand things better before translating it and implementing what is being done. Since this part is originally in C, I choose to look into Zig which increases the difficulty as I've never programmed in Zig before.

In this part, my struggles were mostly about inexperience in writing Zig as well as knowing I want to implement some things. One of the doubts I had was if I wanted to take advantage of Zig's `std.ArrayList` or make my own for the `Chunk` struct. Format strings are also different from what I'm used to dealing with, so I took quite a bit of time to translate the c format strings to these. Other than that, everything seems to indicate that I'm going to have fun with Zig, as well as with the rest of the book.
