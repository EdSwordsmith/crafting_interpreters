# 1 - Introduction's Challenges

Created the hello world projects with the names of the lox interpreters the book is going to use, so that I can reuse these for the interpreters.
Even though these were simple, it was fun to go back to the basics of C and implement some function for double linked lists, I didn't implement them all but it was still fun.

After I'm finished going through the book, I plan on doing it again but in another language, most likely rust.
