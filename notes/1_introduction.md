# 1 - Introduction

Initially I was going to go through the book normally, writing the first part in Java (as you can see in my commit history), but I ended up having some second thoughts and decided that I'll be using rust.

I'll still be using c for the second part, only decided to switch Java with rust. Anyway, I've kept the java "hello world" in the challenges.

For the first challenge of this page "*There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the little system I cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?*", I found the following domain-specific languages:
- Bash
- Markdown
- Make
- XML
- SCSS
- HTML (Mustache Templates)

For the doubly linked list challenge, I decided to try and code in a different way for fun. Made a few macros for creating a "RESULT" struct similar to how Result is used in Rust and used it in every function that could return an error.
