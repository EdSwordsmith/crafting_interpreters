# 23 - Jumping Back and Forth

I really enjoyed this part and I found no obstacles that were hard to overcome. The bytecode generated is mostly similar to what I remember doing in my Compilers course, where we actually compiled to a Stack Machine IR so it's similar to this bytecode and the biggest difference is that the IR used Labels for jumps and, since the compiler wasn't single pass, the increment would actually be compiled after the loop's statement which would allow us to have one jump less. Other than that, I don't have much more to say.
