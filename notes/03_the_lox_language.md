# 3 - The Lox Language

First, I thought of how to make a class inside another class. The language only allows methods inside a class, the only way to accomplish this was defining a class inside a method.

Couldn't really think of any edge case behavior, but I'm curious to see how classes work since they seem to work as objects as well, since we can make a function that returns a class or store one in a variable.

On features that I think are missing I would say the biggest one is arrays, had to make a class for having a list. Another would be anonymous functions, since function declarations aren't expressions. And functional programming functions such as map, reduce, and filter would be nice to have.
