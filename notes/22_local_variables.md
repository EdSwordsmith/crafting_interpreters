# 22 - Local Variables

I actually started reading this part while still going through the global variables challenges, which made me think if it wouldn't be possible to implement the globals in the same way. However, I realize this would make it use a lot more of the stack and ends up being "similar" to what happens with C where global variables aren't stored in the stack. The code in this part was mostly easy, the challenge I faced was trying to find a way to represent unitialized variables differently, but I ended up going with the approach used in the book.

## Challenges

2. I think I said this before in one of the challenges for the tree walking interpreter, but one of the languages I'm mostly familiar is Rust. In Rust shadowing is allowed anywhere and with that expression it would be defining a new variable `a` with the value of the existing variable with the same name. In contrast, Zig doesn't allow shadowing at all even if it's in different scopes.
